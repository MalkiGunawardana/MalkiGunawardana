             conservation.<br><br>

            Situated near Galle, the Sea Turtle Farm benefits from the region's rich biodiversity and proximity to turtle nesting sites. The facility is
             home to various species of sea turtles, including the endangered green turtle, hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, and loggerhead turtle.
              The farm provides a safe environment for these turtles, offering protection from predators, poaching, and other threats they face in the wild.<br><br>

            The history of the Galle Sea Turtle Farm is rooted in the recognition of the declining turtle populations and the need for conservation efforts.
             The center collaborates with local communities, fishermen, and volunteers to rescue injured turtles, collect eggs for incubation, and release hatchlings
              into the ocean. Educational programs are also conducted to raise awareness among visitors about the importance of sea turtle conservation and the
               preservation of marine ecosystems.<br><br>

            The value of the Galle Sea Turtle Farm lies in its contribution to the conservation of these ancient and endangered creatures. By rehabilitating injured
             turtles, protecting nesting sites, and conducting research, the center plays a crucial role in the long-term survival of these species. Visitors to the
              farm can engage in educational tours, learn about the life cycles of sea turtles, and even participate in releasing hatchlings into the ocean.<br><br>

            The Galle Sea Turtle Farm serves as a beacon of hope for the future of sea turtles and the marine environment. Through its conservation efforts, it aims
             to create a sustainable future where these magnificent creatures can thrive. A visit to the farm not only offers a unique opportunity to observe sea turtles
